# Ethos24

- Coding Club IITG brings to you Ethos 2024 , the largest hackathon in North East India!
- This Project is part of challenge by Saptang Labs under the Ethos programme
-  Our task is to develop a cutting-edge secure communications app
   that ensures privacy and security for messaging, voice, and video communications. 
   This app must seamlessly function across desktop, Android, and iOS platforms 
   while integrating advanced encryption and security features, 
   such as message expiration, secure file sharing,and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   This challenge is designed to push the boundaries of cross-platform secure communications.
